This Django-based eCommerce website is developed for my family's business. It consists of three main apps, utilizes media storage for product images, includes a dashboard accessible only by admins, and incorporates middleware for various functionalities. Additionally, the admin dashboard features AJAX integration and a to-do list, and the project includes a Telegram bot.

## Features:

- **Three Apps Structure:** Organized into three apps within the Django project for better modularity and maintainability.

- **Media Storage for Products:** Uses Django's media storage to manage and serve product images.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Includes a dedicated dashboard accessible only by admins for managing products, orders, and other site functionalities.

- **Middleware:** Implements middleware for handling various tasks such as logging, authentication, and request/response modification.

- **AJAX Integration:** Utilizes AJAX for seamless and asynchronous communication between the client and server.

- **Admin Dashboard To-Do List:** Provides a to-do list feature within the admin dashboard for managing tasks efficiently.

- **Telegram Bot:** Integrates a Telegram bot for handling specific functionalities or providing notifications.
